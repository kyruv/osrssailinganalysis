people who dont want sailing are just mad they cant get free dps from a skill that doesnt impact other gameplay at all

if this passes you lose 30-40% of your community. enjoy

you should have held a head to head poll with the two most popular skills from the first vote. sailing would have lost the follow up poll!
like crafting
its gonna be water runecrafting
can i get an enhance almost x2 dry
both like summoning prolly
next to agility
how long do you think it'll take for bots to take over sailing?
!poll
so why can you hire npcs to a ship but can't hire npcs to help with slayer tasks for example?
whale watching
@blizzard_cuck hey it's true, she's useless lol just like this skill is going to be.
rc
i dont care how long 99 takes
big ole plushie with chubby cheeks

if you think sailing would "kill" the game you're braindead
pleease dont make it like mining
aware agility
wyrm pet?
any word on how leaves will be used?
yea you need room to grow
firemaking is the worst skill in the game
more content doesn’t need sailing that’s the problem with sailing. 99% of sailing can be done without sailing
just say we dont know
!membership
don't make it rs3 fast plz
make it 900k xp/h afk
125k xp/hr is solid
she doesnt even know what the fastest skill to train is.
@meend -> what are you on about? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
that's a tad too many emotes, @meend (warning)
water agility
@mylaundrybasket no
toospicy toospicy
@playgamesforlyfe or agility
we want 20k xp per hour or its not old school!!!! kappa
each action will give 15xp
veto
! makeshift
give atleast 200k xp/hour at higher lvl
!membership
130k xp
give us steel titans instead
sailing is actually pretty good, kids just crying for no reason
this isnt old school
@kamikaasie, bad take
this skill was never an option. getting to this stage was planned and forced upon us by the dev team. sailing already had failed once before but osrs dev team doesnt want to lose all the work they already did. they gave us and option of 4 skills and weasled us all the way into this next poll. and i guarantee even if it fails they will still figure out a way to put it in the game.

when is cold war 2?!?!?!
if sailing aint capapble of 500k xph im not interested lul
@blizzard_cuck hahaha
@exiux -> i hope you learned your lesson. [stop spamming caps] [warning]
xp would be similar to old runecrafting
runescape isn't supossed to be enjoyable
true, don't make the best method at lv 60
@alwaysdankrupt no shit bud
leave oldschool oldschool
can we just fix the current skills we have already? sounds like much better idea
clunky ahh boat
1m xp/h
this feels like itbeing a skill is an after thought.
osrs players will cry about anything new i swear
!membership
50k exp an hour guys
eating lvl 99 much?
3tickboating to 200m
so much crying smh
@boepoo who asked.
1m xp/hr or no deal
lobosyep
@clownfiesta0 reddit user by chance?
more effort on valamore less on sailing
poll interface has a typo says "click here to lean more"
not buybale nooooooooooooooooooooo
is it just soggy construction?
@alwaysdankrupt as opposed to what?
unlimited scythe/tumeken charges!!
good
@bobbyflay it hasn't been oldschool since 2014
@alwaysdankrupt neither is nex/toa/dt2/nightmare
mains in shambles
how are people so consistently whining about existing skills? if you dont like half the game then leave. this will  be infinitely better than existing skills because none of them would pass if pitched todya.
@mentalmidgit say that to a ironman
sailing will ruin my maxed only skil locked acc
who's the girl speaking ?
13m xp/h pls
@bigcret1n btw, put leaves on regular compost, u get ultra one. there u go brother
here come hyger
sailing seems more like regular content than a new skill.
arch, invent, and necro worked well because you use them in the end game
bible? prayge
@boepoo that was 5 years ago drama queen
good
@mageezax no
@ggopgankty mod elena
@alwaysdankrupt game would be dead without new things every now and then
bible skills
biblethump bible skills
when is cold war 2? i need my communist penguins!!!!
not bible confirmed
if we wanted new skills we would play rs3
skillspecs is live
people who are complaining about sailing have not read/watched the journey videos.
@plandemics usefulness =/= good skill
@blizzard_cuck poll is out? hold my red bull
@bobbyflay 0head take
shipbuilding new skill confirmed?
@x69freshlymilkedspecs69x who?
so it is water agility

@ultranova_rs it was definetly not 5 years ago but go on
divine sigil didn't pass but someone they rigged sailing
game would be rs3 with these updatesa
!summit
@muumbles_ -> questionable judgement. [stop spamming caps]
that sounds terrible
@bobbyflay scared of a new skill who hurt u haha
@mentalmidgit woodcutting bad skill
friends?

@bobbyflay l take
sailing ge out in sea
mod elena seems real nice but we just dont want sailing
bible in osrs confirmed
chat be like: "oh no new skill my game is ruined my life is ruined i can't be happy anymore people are having fun and game is receiving updates" babyrage go play wow you brainrot kids no wonder you daddy didn't return from buying milk lul
sailing = infinite content
so does that mean sailing pet
@alwaysdankrupt yea torva nex, toa, tob so oldschool lul
gonna be hilarious when this passes with 90%
clipped
@38mgs very accurate
@bobbyflay but people already voted they wanted it
kappa
? mno
true!
will there be group sailing?
atleast make this skill 500k xp p/h!
put the final nail in the coffin and add sailing to the game.
hahahhahahaha
ahoy
stop the cap
bold of you to say
kappa
looool
i hoted yes :)
lol
true
@mattxy8 -> get off the stage. [stop spamming emotes]
lies
slayer will always be the best
forced
agree
biased hahaa
imagine runecraft skill pitch
none buyable skills are usually slow and boring
stil not a skill
how in the world do these updates make this game rs3, do you even know what you're saying?
@plandemics agreed. a lot of skills are bad
irons skill
osrswiseman
any other skill would have been better
constructing a ship gives construstion xp, sailing a ship gives saling xp? mindblow!
wayiza
200k minimum
no voters are so jaded
agreed.
yacht parties
batchest sailing and forestry!!
dungeoneering/summoning/shamanry

<3
big rue
<3
<3
agreed!
sailing sounds like a slog and takes away from the core gameplay. it should be buyable, but slower then actually doing it
remove mutes for begging
team are doing great, ignore the haters
<3
<3 agreed
yes gang
<3
me :o
<3
me :o
saying this is going to be the best skill in the game while the mods just admitted it still has brainstorming to do for it? stop this push for yes
